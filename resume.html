  <h2 class="text-center">Profile</h2>
  <p>I am a software engineer passionate about technology, obsessed with delivering quality products and
    enjoyable user experience to customers.
  </p>
  <p>I've been working as an engineer for about 15 years using mainly Javascript and Java (back in the days).
    Most recently I've been a CTO of an early-stage legal startup, it was a small team so my role
    was mostly hands-on. I was developing the backend, frontend, creating technical architecture and managing our AWS infrastructure.
    I love all parts of development, from design and implementation, over supporting live systems to automation
    and improving the developer experience. I feel it's important to have a holistic understanding of the product
    you're building. I'm also a big fan of self-organising teams and remote working.</p>
  <p>My favourite thing about development is the pace of change. The environment evolves so fast and
    that just makes the work so damn interesting!</p>

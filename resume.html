  <h2 class="text-center">Profile</h2>
  <p>I am a full-stack developer passionate about technology, obsessed with clean code and high performance.
    I love crafting simple and intuitive user experience. After all what website users and API consumers
    always want is speed and simplicity.</p>
  <p>I have over 7 years of experience in application design and development. From back-end to front-end,
    from simple e-commerce websites to data processing pipelines and third-party service integrations.
    Very keen on agile practices and self-organising teams.</p>
  <p>My favourite thing about development is the pace of change. The tools, frameworks or languages I use are ever-changing
    and that just makes the work so damn interesting!</p>

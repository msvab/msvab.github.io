  <h2 class="text-center">About</h2>
  <p>I am a Software Engineer and tech enthusiast living in London. I am interested in all things web and love to explore and learn new things.</p>
  <p>I grew up in Dobruška, a small town in the Czech Republic. Having been always passionate about technology and especially the internet,
    I ended up studying Information Technology at Brno University of Technology.</p>
  <p>About seven years ago I moved to London and have been enjoying the city ever since. I have mostly worked as a Fullstack Developer and
    currently I am working at <a href="https://envisionworld.co/" target="_blank">Envision</a>.</p>
  <p>When I'm not working you can usually find my in the closest gym, playing badminton or conquering Spanish. When it's
    <a href="https://isitbeeroclock.com/" target="_blank">beer o'clock</a>, I'm happy to hit the local pub for a nice pint of craft beer.
    And finally, when I manage to get some more time off, I just love travelling!</p>

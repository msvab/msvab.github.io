  <h2 class="text-center">About</h2>
  <p>I am a CTO, software engineer and tech enthusiast living in Prague. I am interested in all things web and love to explore and learn new things.</p>
  <p>I grew up in a small town in the Czech Republic. Having been always passionate about technology and especially the internet,
    I ended up studying Information Technology at Brno University of Technology.</p>
  <p>I've lived in London for about seven years and that's where I've learned the most. Absolutely love the city.</p>
  <p>About five years ago I moved to Prague and have been enjoying the city ever since. My background is fullstack development and
    most recently I've worked as a CTO of <a href="https://alacritylaw.co/" target="_blank">Alacrity Law</a>.</p>
  <p>When I'm not working you can usually find my in the closest crossfit box, playing badminton or conquering Spanish. When it's
    <a href="https://isitbeeroclock.com/" target="_blank">beer o'clock</a>, I'm happy to hit the local pub for a nice pint of craft beer.
    And finally, when I manage to get some more time off, I just love travelling!</p>

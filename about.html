  <h2 class="text-center">About</h2>
  <p>I am a Web Developer and tech enthusiast living in London. I am interested in all things web and love to explore and learn new things.</p>
  <p>I grew up in Dobru≈°ka, a small town in the Czech Republic. Having been always passionate about technology and especially the internet,
  I ended up studying Information Technology at Brno University of Technology.</p>
  <p>About three years ago I moved to London and have been enjoying the city ever since. I've always worked as a Web Developer and
  currently I am working at <a href="http://www.gamesyscorporate.com/">Gamesys</a> and prototyping a few ideas of my own.</p>
  <p>I enjoy working on various areas from frontend and backend development, to technical design and idea validation.
  But at the core I am a developer with a track record of building various ecommerce and data processing platforms and
  quite a few rest APIs.</p>
